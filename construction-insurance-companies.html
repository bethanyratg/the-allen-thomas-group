A commercial auto policy provides protection for vehicles used for work or to transport tools and other contractor materials. People who work for themselves without employees generally aren't required to carry workers' comp insurance, but it would still be wise to purchase coverage as health insurers may deny claims related to work-related injuries and could leave you facing costly medical expenses and lost income while you can't work.

<div> Liability insurance provides contractors with financial protection against claims arising from bodily injury or property damage during their work.  Contractors insurance usually covers business liability exposures, such as injuries or damage to a client’s property for which your business is responsible.  As a contractor, you are responsible for the safety and security of the property you are working on, and accidents can happen.  Contractor insurance is crucial for protecting both contractors and their clients from financial risks and liabilities associated with accidents or property damage.  Contractor insurance is crucial for protecting both contractors and their clients from financial risks and liabilities associated with accidents or property damage.<br><br>  General liability insurance is particularly important as it provides coverage for third-party bodily injury and property damage claims that may arise during the course of a project.  For example, if a contractor accidentally damages a client's property while working on a project, their insurance policy can cover the costs of repairing or replacing the damaged property.  Independent contractors typically have obligations under their work contracts regarding insurance requirements that must be fulfilled, which often state whether the company needs to be added as additional insured.   Independent contractors typically have obligations under their work contracts regarding insurance requirements that must be fulfilled, which often state whether the company needs to be added as additional insured. <br><br>  Our team of specialists can work within your budget to find tailored auto and business policies.
