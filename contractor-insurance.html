<p>Construction is an naturally risky industry. Each job site brings potential for injuries, property damage, and expensive lawsuits. Just one incident can cripple your business if you&#39;re not properly insured. From general liability to workers&#39; comp to builder&#39;s risk, contractors need several types of insurance. Yet many make the mistake of being underinsured or having gaps in coverage. Don&#39;t let this happen to you. As a contractor myself, I&#39;ve seen firsthand how crucial insurance is. At The Allen Thomas Group, our trusted advisors will analyze your business risks and recommend comprehensive policies to protect you. With the right insurance partner, you can run your business with confidence assured you&#39;ve safeguarded your company&#39;s finances and reputation. This guide will provide an overview of essential coverages, insurance costs, and tips for choosing the best insurance agency for your contracting business.</p>

<p>Why Contractors Need Insurance</p>

<p>Running a contracting business comes with many risks that can lead to expensive claims, lawsuits, or losses. Without proper insurance, a single incident could devastate your finances or even put you out of business. Some key reasons contractors need insurance include:</p>

<p>- Lawsuits - You may face liability claims over property damage, injuries, mistakes, and more. The right insurance protects you if sued.</p>

<p>- Employee injuries - Workers&#39; comp insurance is required in most states to cover medical bills and lost wages for injured employees.</p>

<p>- Property damage - Accidents happen. Builder&#39;s risk and equipment/tools coverage protects you if items are damaged or stolen at a job site. </p>

<p>- Contract requirements - Many construction contracts require you to carry certain insurance limits and name the client as an additional insured.</p>

<p>- Reputational damage - Lawsuits and uncovered losses can harm your business&#39; reputation. Insurance helps cover losses so you can keep your good name.</p>

<p>- Business investments - Your tools, equipment, offices and other business assets represent a major investment. Property insurance protects your assets in a loss. </p>

<p>Adequate insurance gives you security and peace of mind to focus on your work, not risks. It&#39;s a vital cost of being a contractor.</p>

<p>Key Coverages for Contractors</p>

<p>As a contractor, you need several types of insurance for full protection. Here are essential policies every contractor should carry:</p>

<p>- General liability insurance - This covers claims of bodily injury, property damage, personal injury, and advertising injury. It protects you in lawsuits, employee injuries, 3rd party property damage, etc. </p>

<p>- Workers&#39; compensation - Pays for medical treatment and lost wages for employees injured on the job. It&#39;s mandated in most states.</p>

<p>- Builder&#39;s risk insurance - Also called course of construction, it covers projects under construction for perils like theft, vandalism, fire damage, natural disasters.</p>

<p>- Business auto insurance - Covers liability and damage involving vehicles used for business purposes like work trucks. </p>

<p>- Tools, equipment, and materials coverage - Insures business tools, equipment, supplies/inventory for loss or damage at the job site or in transit.</p>

<p>- Professional liability - Required for design/build contractors and covers mistakes in your professional work.</p>

<p>- Commercial property - Protects your offices, warehouses, showrooms for perils like fire, theft, vandalism, smoke damage, etc.</p>

<p>This mix of insurance coverages provides vital protection for your contracting business&#39;s exposures. A great agent can evaluate your unique risks and recommend optimal coverage, limits and additions like umbrella policies.</p>

Without insurance, you would have to pay out of pocket to defend yourself in court and also pay for damages.
