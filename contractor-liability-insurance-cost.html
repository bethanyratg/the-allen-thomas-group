<div>Given the growing trend of employees working from home due to pandemic influenza, is your business prepared for all its potential repercussions?  Without insurance, you would have to pay out of pocket to defend yourself in court and also pay for damages.  Professional Liability Insurance: Also known as Errors and Omissions (E&O) insurance, this coverage is crucial for contractors who provide professional services or advice.  In addition to commercial general liability insurance, independent contractors may need other types of small business insurance, including:Every state requires this coverage for vehicles that are registered to a business, or the ability to compensate someone in case of an auto accident.  They could be sued for damaging client property, causing bodily injury, or advertising injury; general liability coverage helps cover legal fees and damages from any lawsuits that might arise against them.   They could be sued for damaging client property, causing bodily injury, or advertising injury; general liability coverage helps cover legal fees and damages from any lawsuits that might arise against them. <br><br>  Contractors should work closely with their legal team to explore settlement options that align with their best interests.3.
